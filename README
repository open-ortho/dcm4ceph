** Compiling

If you are not familiar with maven, these guidelines will get you
started.

1. Download and install maven (http://maven.apache.org) 2. run "mvn
insall" in this directory of the source code. 3. run "mvn
assembly:assembly" in dcm4ceph-dist directory

You will find packages waiting for you in dcm4ceph-dist/target/

** Running

In bin/ you will find scripts to execute the classes in lib/. Just run
them, and see what happens.
