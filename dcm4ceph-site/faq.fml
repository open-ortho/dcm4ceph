      <question>Where did dcm4ceph come from?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        <b>dcm4ceph</b> started as a project for a master's thesis at the Universidade de Bras√≠lia,
        Brazil in 2006. The thesis has to do with defining a standard for the orthodontic electronic 
        health record, but because of the vast domain of this project, it was decided to limit
        the work to cephalograms only. This set of JAVA classes were used to prove the 
        functionality of the written standard.
